# Duel Gambling Game

This project allows users to enter for a predetermined USDC amount. Once two users have entered, one is picked at random and sent the winnings.
A call to Chainlink VRF is used to produce the randomness. For testing purposes a mock USDC contract is included, as well as VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.
